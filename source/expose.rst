Exposing cluster nodes with dedicated IP addresses
==================================================

Using single entry point vs. accessing MongoDB Instances
--------------------------------------------------------

|operator| provides two scenarios for accessing the database.

#. If :ref:`operator.sharding` mode is turned **on** (default behavior), then
   database cluster runs special ``mongos`` Pods - query routers, which acts as
   an entry point for client applications,

#. If :ref:`operator.sharding` mode is turned **off**, the application needs
   access to all MongoDB Pods of the replica set:

You can find more on sharding in the `official MongoDB documentation <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/glossary/#term-sharding>`_.

Accessing the Pod
-----------------

When Kubernetes creates Pods, each Pod has an IP address in the
internal virtual network of the cluster. Creating and destroying
Pods is a dynamic process, therefore binding communication between Pods to
specific IP addresses would cause problems as things change over
time as a result of the cluster scaling, maintenance, etc. Due to
this changing environment, you should connect to Percona Server for
MongoDB via Kubernetes internal DNS names in URI
(e.g. using ``mongodb+srv://userAdmin:userAdmin123456@<cluster-name>-rs0.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local/admin?replicaSet=rs0&ssl=false`` to access one of the Replica Set Pods).
URI-based access is strictly recommended.

Sometimes you cannot communicate with the Pods using the Kubernetes internal DNS
names. To make Pods of the Replica Set accessible, |operator| can assign a `Kubernetes
Service <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/>`_
to each Pod.

This feature can be configured in the ``replsets`` (for MondgoDB instances Pod) 
and ``sharding`` (for mongos Pod) sections of the
`deploy/cr.yaml <https://github.com/percona/percona-server-mongodb-operator/blob/main/deploy/cr.yaml>`_
file:

-  set ‘expose.enabled’ option to ‘true’ to allow exposing Pods via
   services,
-  set ‘expose.exposeType’ option specifying the IP address type to be
   used:

   -  ``ClusterIP`` - expose the Pod’s service with an internal static
      IP address. This variant makes MongoDB Pod only reachable from
      within the Kubernetes cluster.
   -  ``NodePort`` - expose the Pod’s service on each Kubernetes node’s
      IP address at a static port. ClusterIP service, to which the node
      port will be routed, is automatically created in this variant. As
      an advantage, the service will be reachable from outside the
      cluster by node address and port number, but the address will be
      bound to a specific Kubernetes node.
   -  ``LoadBalancer`` - expose the Pod’s service externally using a
      cloud provider’s load balancer. Both ClusterIP and NodePort
      services are automatically created in this variant.

If this feature is enabled, URI looks like
``mongodb://userAdmin:userAdmin123456@<ip1>:<port1>,<ip2>:<port2>,<ip3>:<port3>/admin?replicaSet=rs0&ssl=false``
All IP adresses should be *directly* reachable by application.
